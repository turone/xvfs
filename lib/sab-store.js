// SabStore — mutations of a `sab + virtual` Place on the main thread. The
// kernel owns the allocator, the preparation pipeline, epoch publication and
// ACK-before-free; this store only validates node:fs semantics against the
// live projection and hands raw input to the kernel.
//
// Publication crosses the SAB allocator and (when configured) the
// compression threadpool, so mutations are asynchronous: every method
// returns a Promise that settles once the new version is published, before
// worker ACKs — those only govern when the replaced bytes are released.
//
// Ordering is per key, so the state a method validates against is the state
// its publication is applied to, while unrelated keys never wait. `rename`
// of a file locks both keys at once; `rm` and the `rename` of a directory
// may touch a whole subtree and therefore take an exclusive place barrier,
// which cannot race a write to a child.
//
// `{ directory }`: a key was named with a trailing separator, so the
// operation takes a directory only — a file is ENOTDIR, as on POSIX —
// checked when it runs, never against a file written meanwhile.
