# Examples

Runnable demos covering the main shared-memory-fs use cases. Each subfolder
is self-contained — no extra build steps unless explicitly noted.

| Example                                  | What it shows                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [hot-reload-routes/](hot-reload-routes/) | `provider: 'map', origin: 'virtual'` + `require()` hook; HTTP server whose route handlers are written/replaced at runtime by an "AI agent".                                                |
| [sea-static/](sea-static/)               | One config, two providers: `'sab'` when running with `node`, `'sea'` when packaged with Node SEA. Same HTTP handler in both modes.                                                         |
| [multi-tenant/](multi-tenant/)           | Two `map + virtual` places under one appRoot + global `strict: true` whitelist; demonstrates the boundary `strict` enforces and where it stops.                                            |
| [worker-static/](worker-static/)         | Static HTTP from several worker threads over one SAB copy: `link()` / `attach()`, view leases, zero-copy Range streams, br / gzip representations, live reload of disk and virtual places. |
| [prepared-scripts/](prepared-scripts/)   | `prepare` + `fs.script`: handler sources prepared once, run in a worker with shared V8 cached data, and updated from the worker through a `sab + virtual` place.                           |

These examples are docs-grade and are also covered by the automated smoke suite
in `test-examples/`, run with `npm run test:examples`. That suite is not part of
`npm test`.

The smoke suite validates the runnable examples on the supported Linux and
Windows matrix. It exercises the `sea-static` example in the normal `sab` mode
that ships from source; the full SEA packaging flow remains a documented manual
check.

## Common setup

All examples import shared-memory-fs as a sibling of this folder:

```js
const { VfsConfig, VfsKernel } = require('../..');
const fsPatch = require('../../lib/adapters/fs-patch.js');
const moduleHook = require('../../lib/adapters/module-hook.js');
```

If you copy an example out of the repo, replace those paths with
`require('shared-memory-fs')`, `require('shared-memory-fs/adapters/fs-patch')`
and `require('shared-memory-fs/adapters/module-hook')` — or skip the manual
wiring entirely and start with `node --import shared-memory-fs/register`.
