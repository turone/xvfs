# Architecture and decisions

How shared-memory-fs is built and **why**. Each section states the
decisions in force together with the reasons behind them; [Rejected
designs](#rejected-designs) lists what was considered and turned down, so it
is not reintroduced without new evidence. Keep this file aligned with the
code: a change that alters a decision updates it in the same commit.

## Purpose

Node.js servers that run several `worker_threads` over the same files —
static assets, templates, handler sources, modules. Files are loaded once on
the main thread into pooled `SharedArrayBuffer` segments; every thread reads
zero-copy views of the same bytes. Live changes are published to all threads
atomically; V8 cached data and compressed representations are built once and
shared the same way.

It is deliberately **not** a general-purpose virtual filesystem (see
[alternatives.md](alternatives.md) for `node:vfs`), not a sandbox for
untrusted code and not a persistence layer.

Engines: `>=22.22.3 <23 || >=24.12.0 <25 || >=26` — the floor of
`module.registerHooks` with CommonJS `--import` bootstrap of memory-only
modules. Early Node 24 bypasses `registerHooks` for nested `require()` from
CommonJS executed by the ESM translator.

## Places and configuration

**A place is one directory under `appRoot`; its name is also the mount, the
cache namespace and the snapshot/delta key.** _Why:_ one identifier and no
mapping table; the router maps any path to its place with one lookup on the
first path segment; a place is enabled or disabled without rewriting paths.

**Provider (where bytes live) and origin (where content comes from) are
independent axes.** `sab` / `sea` keep bytes in the SAB pool, `map` in a
per-thread Map, `disk` / `node-default` are passthrough mounts; `sab` and
`map` read a directory (`origin: 'disk'`) or take application writes
(`origin: 'virtual'`). _Why:_ the four `sab`/`map` × `disk`/`virtual`
combinations cover a worker-shared cache, shared scratch state, a per-thread
cache and per-thread scratch space with one code path each.

**Domains `fs`, `require`, `import` each filter by extension; the scanner
reads the union once.** _Why:_ the patched `node:fs` and the module hooks see
the same files under different policies (a place may serve html to fs and
only js to require), and a file is read from disk once.

**Configuration is resolved and validated once, then deep-frozen;
`config.raw` is the structured-cloneable input workers rebuild from;
functions (preparers) never enter it.** _Why:_ workers receive the config by
structured clone and must resolve exactly the same places; a frozen config
cannot drift between threads; invalid combinations fail at construction,
before anything is read — e.g. `compress.retainRaw: false` on a virtual
place (no raw file to serve) or `prepare` on a passthrough provider. Every
resolved value is explicit (origin, `fs.fallback`), so a resolved config
describes itself.

**A place's projection indexes the directories its source keys imply
(`PlaceFiles`: `Map<dir, Set<name>>`), kept by the projection's own `set`
and `delete`.** A directory lookup costs the depth of its key, a listing
the size of what it lists. _Why:_ directory lookups sit on hot paths —
routing a directory or a miss, `stat`, `exists`, listings, the hierarchy
check before every new key — and scanning every key made each linear in
the size of the place (a third of a millisecond at 50 000 keys, against a
tens of nanoseconds indexed). Kept inside the Map, the index follows every
writer — kernel deltas, Map stores, worker snapshots — without one call
site to forget; filling it costs about 0.3 µs per key.

## Storage

**Pooled SAB segments (default 64 MiB), a best-fit allocator; emptied
segments are reused, never returned to the OS.** _Why:_ one SAB per file
would exhaust mmap regions and fragment the address space; returning a
segment would require every thread to drop its views, which cannot be
coordinated cheaply; reuse is enough.

**Companions — bytecode flavors and compressed representations — are
separate entries under NUL-separated keys.** _Why:_ every entry stays one
contiguous extent, companions travel through snapshot, delta, retirement and
compaction without special cases, and a NUL cannot occur in a file name, so
companions never collide with files nor leak into listings.

**Disk files above `maxFileSize` stay disk entries; content without a disk
file of its own — prepared, virtual or SEA sources, and every companion —
never falls back to disk: if it does not fit, its publication is refused
(and `initialize()` fails).** _Why:_ large media do not belong in the pool;
a disk entry must point at a file that holds exactly the content, and for
prepared, virtual or compressed content there is none — a disk entry would
point at the raw source, or at nothing.

## Publication

**One pipeline for every source of content: raw input → the preparer of
its extension (once) → canonical content → bytecode flavors → compressed
representations → one epoch.** Initial scan, watcher, SEA assets, virtual
writes from any thread and Map writes all use it. _Why:_ what a file _is_
cannot differ between init and live updates or between origins, and
atomicity and failure semantics are enforced in one place.

**Index-at-flush: allocations are private until `#flush` commits an epoch
to the index in one synchronous step.** _Why:_ `snapshot()`, `link()` and
compaction only ever see published state; a failed or abandoned attempt
frees only its own bytes; the entry a change replaces is read at commit
time, so two publications can never retire the same version twice.
Consequence: there is no global commit lock — virtual publications of
different keys may overlap.

**One `vfs-update` per epoch or accepted mutation; a file's source and
companions travel together, a companion that failed to rebuild is listed in
`removals` of the same message.** _Why:_ V8 accepts cached data by source
length, not content — a same-length edit next to a stale companion would run
old bytecode silently.

**Watcher epochs run strictly one at a time, in arrival order
(`SerialQueue`); rechecks use the same queue.** _Why:_ epochs processed in
parallel let an older epoch publish over a newer one (new content on disk,
old in the VFS); a FIFO is the simplest correct order, and the debounce
already batches events. The queue is deliberately separate from the per-key
`MutationQueue` of virtual places, which never share a key with a watched
place.

**The watcher sees the disk through `node:fs` as it was when it loaded:
recursive `fs.watch` where it is native (Windows, macOS), elsewhere one
plain `fs.watch` per directory, a new one added as an event shows it, the
ones under a deleted path dropped, a link to a directory never followed.**
_Why:_ on Linux Node builds recursive `fs.watch` over the public
`node:fs`, which `fs-patch` routes: it listed the VFS instead of the disk
and missed new files, and from Node 26.10 a refusal reached it as an
uncaught exception. One watch per directory is also what inotify costs at
least.

**Stable source reads: stat before and after a looped read; a failed
publication keeps the previous version and gets one deferred recheck.**
_Why:_ a file that changes while being read must never be published half
written, and a flapping file must not loop.

**Failure policy.** Init aborts on any unreadable source, preparer error,
failing `fs.script.compile` or path-less input that does not fit. Live
updates keep the previous version and companions. `require.compile` is
best-effort. _Why:_ startup is all or nothing; live traffic keeps serving the
last good version; Node's CommonJS loader compiles fine without cached data,
while a script bundle promises its cached data.

## Lifetime of shared bytes

**A replaced or removed shared version is retired, not freed: it gets a
temporary `retireId` and its bytes return to the pool only after every linked
worker has ACKed the update and no thread still reads it — never on a
timeout.** _Why:_ a freed extent is reused at once; a stream, lease or socket
write queue still holding it would read another file's bytes. An ACK only
means a projection dropped the version, not that its consumers finished; a
timeout would bring the bug back under load.

**The `retireId` exists only from retirement until the free — no permanent
allocation id per entry. It is a monotonic counter of the main kernel,
never reused, and travels beside the change in the update, never inside the
new entry.** Records keep place, key, size and time for internal
diagnostics (`kernel.retirements()`, labels like `static:/a.mp4 [fs:br]#17`,
never parsed back). _Why:_ current entries are identified by (place, key);
a permanent id would bloat every entry and message for the rare case; a
never-reused id means a late release can never match a later retirement.

**A consumer pins only the representation it reads — the source or one
companion; each is retired and freed on its own.** _Why:_ pinning a whole
file bundle, or a segment, for one slow reader would keep unrelated bytes
out of the pool.

**Each thread pins direct consumers by the projected entry object; IPC
happens only when a pinned version is retired: its id in the ACK
(`retained`), then one `vfs-release`.** _Why:_ the projected object is the
identity of a physical version for free; pinning a current version happens
per stream and view and must stay local; reporting the hold inside the ACK
registers it before the ACK can free anything.

**Streams emit owned chunks, released with the stream, unless zero-copy is
on — the place's `fs.zeroCopy`, or `{ zeroCopy }` per call; zero-copy
chunks are released only by `stream.release()`.** node:fs callers (the fs
patch) always get owned chunks. _Why:_ a socket keeps chunks in its write
queue after the source stream ended — releasing on `'end'` would free bytes
still being written; third-party code never calls `release()`.

**Owned-chunk streams release in `_destroy` — the single path of end,
error, `destroy()` and an `AbortSignal`.** _Why:_ one path cannot release
twice; `pipe()` never destroys its source, hence `pipeline()` in the docs.

**Views are explicit leases `{ view, release, [Symbol.dispose] }`, with no
GC backstop — and neither streams nor leases have warning timers: an
unreleased zero-copy stream or lease holds its version until `release()` or
`close()`, visible in `retirements()`.** _Why:_ a Buffer has no lifecycle to
observe; a GC-driven release could free memory while a destructured view or
a `subarray` of it is still in use — use-after-free is worse than a visible
leak; a long pin (a slow download) is normal, not an error.

**`close()` stops active streams (`ERR_VFS_CLOSED`); a worker kernel's
`close()` also closes its link.** _Why:_ after close nothing guards shared
bytes — a worker's streams would otherwise read memory the main thread reuses
once the link is gone.

**A closed link port is the worker's exit: its pending ACKs and its holds
are dropped.** _Why:_ a thread that is gone reads nothing; waiting for it
would keep its retired versions forever.

**`map` places take no part in retirement; their leases and releases are
no-ops.** _Why:_ a Map entry is an owned Buffer the GC keeps alive; an
update never reuses its bytes.

**Compaction moves published entries only and closes the segment it
empties; retired extents never move.** _Why:_ moving a retired extent would
invalidate its readers; the closed segment returns to the pool when its last
retired bytes are freed. Publishing into a closed segment reopens it.

## Preparation

**`prepare` is declared by a domain but prepares the file: one declaration
per extension per place; a second declaration — even of the same preparer —
is a config error, with no domain priority and no merging.** _Why:_ a file
has one canonical content shared by every domain; two declarations would be
ambiguous, and silent priority rules hide configuration mistakes.

**The short form `prepare: 'name'` covers the domain's own finite `ext`; an
unrestricted fs takes only the object form; `fs.script.ext` is never its
scope.** _Why:_ "every file" is not a meaningful preparation target, and the
script extensions are a consumer filter, not a declaration.

**`prepare` routes, it never selects: neither form adds or removes
extensions of a domain or of the scan, and every declaration resolves into
one index `place.prepare = { [ext]: name } | null`.** _Why:_ visibility
stays a function of the consumer filters; one index gives O(1) selection
and no per-domain copy that could disagree.

**On the main thread every preparer an enabled place names must be
registered — `initialize()` checks it before anything is read; a worker
binds only what `attach({ preparers })` gives it.** _Why:_ a missing
function is a deployment error: startup fails, not a later publication.

**Preparers are synchronous, run once per publication attempt and never on
read; returned bytes are copied, `meta` / `scriptOptions` cloned and
deep-frozen.** _Why:_ they run inside synchronous Map writes and the watcher
pipeline; running on read would multiply the CPU cost per thread and
request; cloned, frozen results travel to workers and cannot change after
publication.

**Workers never prepare shared places; `attach({ preparers })` serves only
local writes to a worker's own `map` places, and a missing preparer fails
that write, not the attach.** _Why:_ functions cannot cross threads; the main
kernel owns every shared publication; a worker that only reads never needs
them.

**Appending to or moving away a prepared key is `ENOTSUP`; renaming raw
content onto an extension with a preparer publishes it through that
preparer.** _Why:_ the raw input is not retained and a bundle may embed its
old key — refusing beats publishing a stale bundle.

**`fs.script.compile` and `require.compile` are independent flavors built
from the same canonical source.** _Why:_ different consumers, wrappers and
options — the bare source under the preparer's `scriptOptions` for
`vm.Script`, `Module.wrap(source)` under the module filename for Node's
loader. The library invents no `scriptOptions`.

## Virtual places and worker mutations

**The main kernel alone owns the allocator, preparation, publication,
retirement and compaction; workers mutate `sab + virtual` places through an
RPC over their link port.** The response follows publication — the update is
posted first on the same port — and the payload travels as a detached copy.
_Why:_ one writer keeps allocation single-threaded without locks inside SAB;
a worker sees its own write before its Promise settles.

**Mutations of shared places are asynchronous; `*Sync` forms are `ENOTSUP`;
no `Atomics.wait()`.** _Why:_ blocking a worker on the main thread invites
deadlocks and stalls both.

**Per-key ordering with an exclusive place barrier for subtree operations;
one update per accepted mutation, no coalescing.** _Why:_ each Promise
corresponds to its own publication; validation and publication see the same
state without serializing unrelated keys.

**`link()` / `attach()` is the only worker transport.** _Why:_ one
implementation of the protocol — ACKs, retained versions, releases,
mutations — instead of every integration re-implementing retirement.

**`map` places are per-thread and never part of a snapshot.** _Why:_ fast,
synchronous scratch space without coordination; shared writable state goes
through `sab + virtual`.

**Renaming a virtual entry keeps its mtime, like a rename on disk.** _Why:_
a move is not a write: the content is the same, so is its time — in `sab`
and `map` places alike.

**A virtual place keeps the hierarchy of a filesystem: a path is a file or a
directory, never both. One check (`checkHierarchy`) runs before every
mutation that creates a primary key — write, append, copy, file rename,
subtree move — in `map` and `sab` places alike: a file above the key is
`ENOTDIR`, a directory at it `EISDIR`. A key whose publication has begun
counts as a file until it commits or fails (`SabStore`'s keys in flight),
so two mutations running together cannot create `/f` and `/f/x` both as
files. Directories stay implicit: `mkdir` creates no entry, but answers
from the same hierarchy (`checkMkdir`: `EEXIST`, `ENOTDIR`); `unlink` of
a directory is `EISDIR`, `rm` of one without `recursive` the
`ERR_FS_EISDIR` `node:fs` throws.** _Why:_
implicit directories let `/f.txt` and `/f.txt/x` both exist — a structure
no filesystem has, for which listings, `stat`, subtree operations and a
later copy to disk have no consistent answer. Per-key ordering lets
mutations of different keys overlap, so the published index alone cannot
decide; locking every ancestor would serialize all writes of a directory,
while a set of keys in flight costs nothing when nothing conflicts.

**A write's flag reaches the store: `w…` replaces, `a…` appends, `x` is
`{ exclusive }`, checked in the key's turn like the hierarchy; a flag a
store cannot honor (read, numeric) is `ENOTSUP`. A copy's `COPYFILE_EXCL`
and cp's `force: false` / `errorOnExist` are that same exclusive write.**
_Why:_ exclusive creation is how callers avoid replacing a file; checked
before the queue, it would not be exclusive.

## Routing and strict mode

**The router decides, the adapters execute; `fs-patch` and `module-hook`
never read the config.** _Why:_ one chokepoint, uniform across sync,
callback, promise and guarded APIs.

**Containment is lexical: only a real `..` component leaves `appRoot`; the
router never stats or resolves paths.** _Why:_ `..private` is a legal name
and must route like any other; the router sits on the hot path of every fs
call. Symlink / realpath containment is out of scope.

**A trailing separator names a directory, as on POSIX, on every platform
for what a place serves or stores: the router answers `ENOTDIR` for a
served file named so; a store route keeps the slash on its key, so a file
write is `EISDIR` and `unlink`, `rm` and `rename` hand `{ directory }` to
the store, which checks it when the mutation runs. What passes through
keeps the rules of `node:fs` — on Windows, a trailing separator is
ignored.** _Why:_ the VFS answers the same on every platform, and a path
that names a directory never reaches a file. Checked in the mutation's
own turn, a directory-form `rm` never takes a file written meanwhile.

**A module specifier that names a directory — a trailing `/`, `.`, `..` —
resolves as one only, as Node's resolver does: `require` skips
LOAD_AS_FILE, `import` finds no module; `resolveModule` never takes a path
ending in a separator for a published file.** _Why:_ `require('./lib/')`
must load `lib/index.js`, never a sibling `lib.js`; Node's ESM resolver on
Windows would hand the hooks `x.mjs/` as a file, which the VFS refuses as
on POSIX.

**Strict mode is a routing policy, not isolation.** _Why:_ code can reach
the OS by other means (native addons, child processes, its own hooks) and
worker threads share one process; isolating untrusted code needs OS-level
boundaries.

**Under strict, `appRoot` itself is a managed root: it lists the enabled
places (`readdir`, `opendir`), stats as a directory and refuses native
access (`watch`, writes).** _Why:_ passing the root through listed the
names of unmanaged entries.

**`fs.fallback` belongs to disk-origin places and is always explicit once
resolved: `'deny'` under strict, `'disk'` otherwise.** `'deny'` serves
published canonical entries only; `'disk'` also serves, from disk and inside
that place only, the files its cache filters do not select, and merges them
into listings (the facade serves the same territory). Cached extensions stay
VFS-only under strict; module hooks never fall back. `fs.fallback` governs
reads only: mutations follow `fs.writable`, and a disk write reaches the VFS
only through the watcher — a file outside the cache filters never enters
SAB. An explicit `'disk'` needs a finite `fs.ext`: without one every file is
cached and no disk territory is left (the non-strict default still resolves
to `'disk'`, which then means its permissive reads). Its disk territory is a
route of its own (`'disk'`): native for reads, but a listing (`readdir`,
`opendir`) is always the place's — disk directories and uncached files
only, cached extensions from the published collection — even for a
directory that exists only on disk. _Why:_ partial disk caches — html and
js in SAB, media from disk — under strict routing, without a raw file ever
standing in for canonical (prepared) content or an unpublished version; a
native listing of a disk-only directory showed such raw files. The
non-strict default keeps its permissive reads.

## Patched `node:fs`

**One rule decides what a native `node:fs` operation may do: it runs only
once every path it touches has been routed.** A single-path operation runs
after the routing of its source and destination allows it; a copy or a
rename hands on the source's raw input — never a prepared result or a
companion — and the destination publishes it through its own pipeline; a
recursive or compound operation whose routing could check only its top path
is refused; a virtual destination is never changed by a native disk
operation; a recursive operation from outside `appRoot` is refused when its
walk would enter `appRoot`; unrelated paths outside `appRoot` stay native.
What the kernel cannot guarantee fails with `ENOTSUP` before anything is
read or written. _Why:_ every bypass found had one shape — a native
operation checked one path, then read, listed or changed many: `opendir`
listed hidden files, a recursive `cp` of a place or of a directory above
`appRoot` carried denied files out, `copyFile` into a virtual place left a
stray disk file, a directory `watch` reported hidden names, a recursive
`rm` from above deleted read-only places, a `rename` gave a hidden file a
readable name. A rule per shape closes the class, not the instance.
`ENOTSUP` keeps the contract honest until a VFS-aware implementation exists
(`TASKS.md`); an approximation such as `cp` with a `filter` would still copy
raw bytes and miss virtual entries.

**Every path-taking API is in one of three groups.**

- _Implemented_, served by the places: `readFile`, `stat`, `lstat`,
  `access`, `realpath`, `existsSync`, `readdir`, `opendir`,
  `createReadStream`, `writeFile`, `appendFile`, `unlink`, `mkdir`, `rm`,
  `rename`, `copyFile` and a non-recursive `cp`.
- _Recognized but unsupported for managed territory_ (`ENOTSUP`): `open` of
  a virtual entry; a copy or `rename` of a prepared virtual entry, a copy
  of a place directory; a recursive `cp` of or into managed territory; a
  hard link into or out of a place; `watch` of managed territory; recursive
  walks (`readdir`, `opendir`, `watch`, `rm`, `rmdir`) and `rename` of a
  tree that holds places; a directory renamed across a place's boundary (a
  place's root included); a virtual subtree rename that is not raw-only;
  guarded mutations in a virtual place. A hidden source is `EACCES`.
- _Native passthrough outside managed territory_: unrelated paths outside
  `appRoot`, `disk` / `node-default` places, disk-territory files,
  unmanaged paths without strict; and the guarded APIs (`chmod`, `chown`,
  `utimes`, `truncate`, `symlink`, `readlink`, `statfs`, `watchFile`,
  `rmdir`, `glob`) once every path argument is routed.

_Why:_ an application must be able to tell which calls the VFS serves, which
it refuses and which belong to the operating system — and a new API must
join a group deliberately, never by default.

**Every listing comes from the places: `opendir` is implemented, not
guarded — a `Dir` over the entries `readdir` lists, taken when it is
opened, with the `node:fs` close semantics.** _Why:_ a guarded native
`opendir` was a second listing path: it showed raw disk files a place hides
(unpublished cached extensions, the disk behind `fallback: 'deny'`) and
missed virtual entries. A snapshot keeps it synchronous and simple;
`node:fs` does not promise to show entries changed during an iteration
either.

**`glob` results are filtered by route, relative ones against its `cwd`
option.** _Why:_ glob walks with the `node:fs` functions it captured on first
use — native ones if it ran before the patch — so the filter is the only
boundary; resolving results against `process.cwd()` let a glob with a `cwd`
list what strict routing hides.

**A single-file copy (`copyFile`, a non-recursive `cp`) hands the
destination the source's raw input, and the destination publishes it
through its own pipeline (`FsRouter.copy`).** The raw input of a
disk-origin place — published, prepared or not — is its raw disk file; of
an unprepared virtual or SEA entry, its canonical bytes; a prepared virtual
or SEA entry has none (`ENOTSUP`); a hidden source is `EACCES` before
anything is read. A disk destination gets the raw bytes — in a disk-origin
place its watcher prepares them — and a virtual one is written through its
store: its preparer runs once and no file appears on disk. Raw on disk into
a native destination is `node:fs` itself. Companions are never copied.
`node:fs` options keep their meaning for one file; one the VFS cannot honor
(`COPYFILE_FICLONE_FORCE`, `filter`, `preserveTimestamps`) is `ENOTSUP`.
Errors name the source (`path`) and the destination (`dest`). _Why:_ the
raw input is what a publication consumes, so the destination's policy
decides the content — copying canonical (prepared) content into a place
that prepares the same extension would prepare it twice, and its bundle may
embed the source key. A prepared virtual entry keeps no raw input: feeding
its canonical content in as raw would silently change what the preparer
sees, and a native copy could not write a virtual destination at all.
Compressed or bytecode companions are derived from the content; the
destination rebuilds its own. Refusing every copy of served content made
the most common operation on a disk-origin place impossible.

**A recursive `cp` stays native at both ends: a source or a destination in
a place, or one that encloses `appRoot`, is `ENOTSUP`.** _Why:_ a native
walk reads raw files past the filtered listings, misses virtual entries and
writes a destination's files behind its store; a recursive copy of a place,
or of a directory above `appRoot`, carried files strict routing denies to a
readable destination. A VFS-aware walk is in `TASKS.md`.

**A hard link into or out of an indexed place is `ENOTSUP`
(`FsRouter.link`); a hidden source is `EACCES`.** _Why:_ a hard link is one
physical file under two names, while a place gives every name its own
canonical content, preparation and companions; the second name would also
escape the place's mutation policy: it can be a writable alias of a
read-only place's raw file, and a write through it may never reach the
place's watcher. A copy gives the same bytes without sharing the file.

**A native rename moves the raw file. Both paths pass the mutation
routing and the source the read routing: a hidden source is `EACCES`. A
published disk-origin file may leave `appRoot` or change its extension; the
watchers then drop the old canonical entry and publish the new key by the
policy of its place and extension. A directory moves natively only within
one disk-origin place; across a place's boundary, as a place's root, or as
a tree that holds places it is `ENOTSUP` (`FsRouter.rename`: `crossing`,
`unsupported`).** In a virtual place the store moves an ordinary entry
atomically and keeps its mtime — the preparer of a new extension runs
once — and refuses a prepared one (`ENOTSUP`); a directory moves as a
raw-only subtree (below); across a virtual boundary a rename is `EXDEV`. _Why:_ the raw file is a disk-origin
place's source of truth: moving it hands on exactly what its publication
consumes, and each end republishes it by its own rules — the extension
change of a prepared file is just a new file of the new extension. What made
a rename a bypass was a hidden source: with write access to a disk-origin
place, a rename carried a file strict routing hides out of `appRoot`, or
gave it an extension its place serves from disk. A published source was
readable before it moved; strict routing decides which paths are served, and
a preparer is a publication step, not an access boundary. Within one
disk-origin place a directory keeps its policy, and the watcher republishes
its tree; across a boundary it would change the policy of all its
descendants at once, hidden files included, with nothing routed. A prepared
virtual entry has no raw input, and its bundle may embed the old key
(`scriptOptions.filename`, `meta`, bytecode). A copy and a delete across
places would not be atomic, and a virtual place is a filesystem of its own.

**A virtual directory renames as a whole subtree when every source under it
is raw-only — not prepared, not compiled (`require.compile`,
`fs.script.compile`), without `scriptOptions` or `meta`
(`subtreeMoves`).** Every source and the companions it has — compressed
representations — reappear under the new prefix with their bytes, stat and
mtime, and the old keys go, in one publication: one `vfs-update` for SAB, a
swap of the entries for a Map. Nothing is prepared, compiled or compressed
again. SAB copies each version into a fresh allocation and retires the old
one through ACK-before-free; the move takes the place barrier. One source
that cannot move refuses the whole subtree (`ENOTSUP`); an existing
destination (`ENOTEMPTY`, `ENOTDIR`) and a move into itself (`EINVAL`)
are refused before anything changes; the place's own directory never moves.
_Why:_ implicit directories are no reason to refuse a rename: a prefix
rename changes no content, extension or config, so compressed bytes stay
valid as they are, and recompressing would only cost time. What depends on
the key cannot be carried over — a preparer's input is not kept, bytecode
was compiled under the old filename, metadata may name the old path — and
running the pipeline again is left for later; moving only the other entries
would split the tree. Copying keeps each projection one physical version,
so a pin on an old version keeps protecting its bytes.

**`watch` of managed territory is `ENOTSUP` — a place directory, a
published file, the strict `appRoot`, a recursive watch of a place or of a
tree that holds places — while a file of the disk territory keeps a native
watcher; `fs.promises.watch` reports a refusal when it is iterated.**
_Why:_ a native watcher reports raw disk events: the names a place hides,
changes before or without their publication (a preparation that fails keeps
the previous version), nothing of virtual writes. An event must mean a
publication, and a publication-level watch is in `TASKS.md`. A
disk-territory file is its own content: its events describe what reads
return. `node:fs` reports the errors of `fs.promises.watch` from its
iterator, so a synchronous throw would differ from native behavior.

**A recursive walk, and a `rename`, of a tree that holds places — `appRoot`
passed through without strict, or a directory above it — is `ENOTSUP`; one
level stays native.** _Why:_ such a walk enters the places natively: a
recursive `readdir` from above listed hidden names, a recursive `rm`
deleted the files of read-only places, and a `rename` carried the whole tree
out of `appRoot`, where strict routing no longer reaches it. Only geometry
is checked (`PlaceRegistry.encloses`), so unrelated paths pay nothing.

**APIs the patch does not implement are guarded passthrough; a guarded
mutation in a virtual place is `ENOTSUP`, and so is `open()` of a virtual
entry.** _Why:_ an unimplemented API must not become a bypass; only its
store changes a virtual place — a native `copyFile` into one left a stray
disk file the place never showed; SAB / Map entries have no file
descriptor.

**A wrapper calls its original once no kernel is installed, and each
`install()` wraps the restored originals.** _Why:_ a reference taken while
the patch was installed — a module's destructured `node:fs`, the functions
glob keeps from its first use — outlives `uninstall()`; it threw a
`TypeError` on the kernel that was gone, which glob swallowed into an empty
result. Wrapping the restored originals keeps repeated install / uninstall
from stacking wrappers.

**Listings sort and deduplicate the string names, then encode them as
asked; a recursive `encoding: 'buffer'` listing works in places.** _Why:_
the encoding must not change order or duplicates, and a Buffer name cannot
be compared with a string key. Native `node:fs` (22.22.3 to 26.x) fails
`recursive` with `encoding: 'buffer'` — its callback form even crashes the
process — which is a defect, not a documented contract.

## Hooks and bootstrap

**One `module.registerHooks` chain for `require()` and `import`; modules
keep plain `file:` URLs; a `_compile` patch applies cached data and falls
back to the original compiler once.** _Why:_ in-thread synchronous hooks,
the same identity as files on disk (`import.meta.url`, `__filename`,
`require.cache`), bytecode reuse without changing module semantics; a
throwing module body is never re-executed.

**`load` returns the source decoded to a string.** _Why:_ the ESM loader
may compile after an async gap, when the shared bytes could already belong
to a newer version.

**`--import shared-memory-fs/register` bootstraps the main thread;
workers call `attach()`.** _Why:_ preloads do not run in worker threads.

## Invariants

- Projections are `Buffer.from(sab, offset, length)` views; `readFile*`
  returns owned copies; direct access goes through leases and streams that
  pin their version.
- The config is deep-frozen and never mutated at runtime.
- The index holds published entries only; every publication commits in one
  synchronous `#flush`.
- A retired version is freed only after all linked workers ACKed its update
  and no thread holds it; nothing is freed on a timeout.
- Compaction never moves or overwrites retired bytes; emptied segments are
  reused, never returned to the OS.
- Source and companions of a file are published in one `vfs-update`.
- Watcher epochs never overlap.
- A closed kernel publishes nothing and arms no timer: a watcher event
  whose `stat` lands after `close()` is dropped.
- Companions never appear in `readdir`, `exists`, routing or the patched fs;
  `Place.companions(key)` enumerates them — never hand-roll key lists.
- Kernel-internal disk I/O (kernel, scanner, watcher, disk territory in
  `PlaceFs`) uses `node:fs` functions captured at load time, so the patch
  never blocks the kernel.
- `watchPath()` is a load-bearing workaround (nodejs/node#63638: an 8.3
  alias in a watched path aborts libuv on Windows); remove it only when the
  engines floor clears every affected release.
- `install()` records every replaced `node:fs` property and `uninstall()`
  restores them in reverse; `.native` variants are preserved; with no
  kernel installed a wrapper is its original.
- Listings are sorted and deduplicated by string name before any encoding.
- A preparer runs once per publication attempt, on the publishing thread,
  never on read; its raw input is never kept in the VFS; a prepared source
  is never a disk entry; `prepare` and `scriptOptions` never turn
  `fs.script` on.
- No native listing, copy, link, rename or watch runs over managed
  territory past its routing; a refusal comes before any disk read or
  write.
- A copy or a rename hands on the raw input only — never a prepared result
  or a companion; the destination prepares it once, and a virtual
  destination never gets a disk file.
- A virtual subtree moves in one publication or not at all.
- A virtual path is a file or a directory, never both — also while
  mutations overlap.
- A projection's directory index says what a scan of its keys would say.
- Disk territory never leaves its place (`PlaceFs.#within`) and, under
  strict, never serves or lists a cached extension.

## Protocol

```
snapshot    { segments: [{ id, sab }], places: { <name>: { entries: [[key, entry]] } } }
vfs-update  { name, updateId, places: { <name>: { entries, removals, retired: [[key, retireId]] } },
              newSegments: [{ id, sab }] }                                    main → worker
vfs-ack     { name: 'vfs-ack', updateId, retained?: [retireId] }              worker → main
vfs-release { name: 'vfs-release', retireIds: [retireId] }                    worker → main
vfs-mutate  { name, id, place, op, key, to?, options?, data? }                worker → main
vfs-mutated { name, id, error?: { code, message, syscall, path, dest } }      main → worker
entry       shared { kind, segmentId, offset, length, stat, scriptOptions?, meta? }
            | disk { kind, path, stat, scriptOptions?, meta? }
stat        { size, mtimeMs } (+ sourceSize, encoding for compressed companions)
```

## Testing

- `npm test` runs `test/*.test.js`; `npm run test:examples` runs the
  example smoke suite; `npm run lint` is eslint + prettier. CI covers Linux
  and Windows on Node 22.22.3 / 22.x / 24.12.0 / 24.x / 26.x.
- Concurrency tests are deterministic: gate the injected reader
  (`k.cache.reader`), emit watcher epochs by hand and await
  `k.watchQueue.idle`, observe publication on the main side
  (`k.nextUpdateId`, `k.acks`, `k.retired`, `k.retirements()`), and use
  in-thread links (`test/helpers.js`: `tap`, `worker`, `nextMessage`)
  instead of timers. Tests over real `fs.watch` events or real workers wait
  only for a condition to become true (`until`); nothing sleeps to prove
  that something did not happen.
- Hooks are installed only inside a test and uninstalled in `after` /
  `finally`; bootstrap tests run child processes.
- glob captures the `node:fs` functions it walks with when it is loaded,
  and a `node --test` child loads it before any test runs: a glob that kept
  the patched functions is tested in a plain node process
  (`test/fixtures/glob-kept.cjs`).
- A refused operation is tested for its error (`code`, `syscall`, `path`,
  `dest`) and for leaving nothing behind — no copy, no deletion, no move.
- Prove V8 cached-data acceptance in a worker: the per-isolate compilation
  cache masks `cachedDataRejected` in the compiling thread.
- `npm ci` must work without git or SSH access: git dependencies are pinned
  as HTTPS tarball URLs with lockfile integrity.
