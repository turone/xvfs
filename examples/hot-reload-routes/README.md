# hot-reload-routes

HTTP server whose route handlers live entirely in a `map + virtual` VFS place.
A simulated agent writes new `.js` files into the place at runtime; subsequent
HTTP requests immediately see them via patched `require()`.

## Run

```
node examples/hot-reload-routes/server.js
```

## Try

```
curl http://localhost:3000/hello   # initial route
# wait 2 s
curl http://localhost:3000/time    # written by agent at +2 s
# wait 2 s
curl http://localhost:3000/echo?x=1  # written by agent at +4 s
# wait 2 s
curl http://localhost:3000/hello   # /hello replaced with new body at +6 s
```

## What this shows

- `provider: 'map', origin: 'virtual'` place with `fs: { writable: true }` is
  fully writable; `kernel.fs('routes').writeFile(key, source)` is the API
  used by the agent.
- The module hook resolves absolute paths inside the place even when the
  file does not exist on disk (map places have no disk backing), and
  `require: true` gives each written route V8 bytecode.
- Hot reload = `delete require.cache[absPath]` after each write. The next
  `require()` recompiles from the updated buffer.
- `require: true` already compiles V8 bytecode (`require.compile` defaults
  to `true`); it is rebuilt on every write automatically.
